Joined the company - Al Fahal International

For the first week of my Internship. Interview was taken by the company and they have given a demo of their websites and software.
Their main product is resturant software. Then they gave different tasks like making form for new customers(name,budget,type).
Company provides the information about how they actually works.

Our team, which consist myself, Neeraj and Tisha, was assigned the section to remodel the Restaurant portion of the website.

We segregated our work into different sections and started working on different ideas, which we can combine later on and create a functional website.


Our mentor Mr.Dharmesh Shah gave a task of making a website by giving an options like (Resturant,laboratory,Hospital.. etc).
We decided to make a laboratory website. First we create a functional diagram of our website to get an idea of how much work we have to do.

As our company is international, we were allowed to work from home. Our team came up with different features and function which will be beneficial to possibilities were discussed by us.

There was one drawback as we were not working on site, the UI and backend portion were easy to manage and combine; But the database part is configured to only one device. 
Temporarily, we all created same databases on our own devices so we can each try on our own level.

We had started to realized that we need to learn some concepts to work further. So we were hands-on trying to learn database connectivity, 
managing data and revise different technologies for UI like Bootstrap, AngularJS etc. Then we started working on website by following our functional diagram. 
Our mentor has also provided his guidance when we are facing any difficulty.
